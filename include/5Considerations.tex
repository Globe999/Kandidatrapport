\chapter{Considerations}
Drones are generally considered to be environmentally friendly, there are however certain risks that come with drones and car testing.
\section{Ethical aspects}
Although the project might not have a direct impact on the general public's life in an ethical aspect nor in a socio-economic point of view, there are still some important considerations to keep in mind. Currently, AstaZero performs manual calculations and transmissions of paths, meaning that it requires man-hours. Upon completion of this project, the work-load will likely decrease, leading to a shift in labor distribution. Although the elimination of manual adjustments could lead to a reduced demand for staff it is deemed to be a non-feasible outcome. Contrariwise the development of the app will serve as a foundation for further software development, implying an increase of labor demand. Additionally there will be a need for app-maintenance and quality control, creating even more job opportunities. 

In terms of ethical aspects there are few more things to keep in mind. The project will include video documentation, and it is crucial to abide the laws and relevant guidelines in this regard. Furthermore, during the NCAP tests there may be vehicles and classified information that should not be filmed. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the implementation of the drone app to ensure that the captured footage is limited only to the desired vehicle and does not include any sensitive or restricted information.

\section{Environmental aspects}
As with many electric appliances or vehicles, most drones are powered by lithium batteries. The production of lithium batteries come with many environmental problems, such as a lot of water being used when mining for lithium, which dries surrounding land and severely harms the local ecosystem~\cite{BauerSophie2020Explainer:Industry}. Potential leakage that has been known to occur in these mines can poison the surrounding wild life~\cite{AmitKatwala2018TheAddiction}. However, the implementation of drones is not unique to our project, our goal is to automate the drones instead of manually flying them. To truly consider environmental aspects of the project, one should consider alternatives to drones capturing the footage from the tests. Since the implementation of drones, footage from a camera moving alongside a car is possible. This footage can probably provide better material to analyse a car's performance in certain tests. Alternatives to having a drone move alongside a car being tested include filming from some other vehicle. Few vehicles are however as light as drones, and if the battery is charged with electricity from renewable sources, the environmental impact of using the drone can be considered almost negligible.
