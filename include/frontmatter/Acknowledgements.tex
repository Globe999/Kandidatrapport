\section*{Acknowledgements}
The group would like to express our gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the completion of this project. Firstly, we would like to thank our contact person at AstaZero, Victor Jarlow. Without his assistance and guidance this project would likely not be as successful. \\

Secondly we would like to extend our gratitude to the team from Penn State University, namely Daniel Dean, Brian Simons, Jamin Valick, Xinxheng Zhang, and Mohammed Alawadhi, for their valuable contributions. We feel privileged to have had the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with such exceptional students.

Thirdly, we wish to convey our sincere appreciation to the supervisors of the Penn State University team, namely Nick Vlajic and Jason Moore, for their guidance and insights throughout the course of this project.
\\

We would also like to extend our appreciation to our supervisor Martin Fabian for the helpful input he has provided during the project. 
\\

Furthermore we would like to thank Mikael Enelund for constantly being open for discussion, and continuously being most helpful regarding all the different aspects of conducting a project within a large group. 
\\

Thank you for all your contributions, sincerely
