\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this project is to develop a system for the automatic documentation of Euro NCAP tests using drones. Specifically, the objective is to create a design showcase that demonstrates how three automated drones can follow the vehicle under test from various angles during testing on the AstaZero proving ground.

To accomplish this goal, an object detection algorithm has been developed to enable the cameras on the drones to continuously maintain direct focus on the vehicle under test, regardless of external factors such as wind or differences in vehicle speeds. This approach is intended to enhance the system's robustness and ensure that the cameras capture high-quality footage throughout the test.

The resulting footage captured by the three drones will be made available to the test driver via tablets placed in the vehicle under test. This feature provides the driver with an opportunity to easily monitor the test from multiple perspectives and gain a better understanding of the vehicle's performance under different conditions.

Overall, this project represents an important stride forward in the automation of Euro NCAP tests, and has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of these tests in the future.
